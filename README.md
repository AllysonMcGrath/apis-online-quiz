# Web APIs-Online Quiz

## Description

This is a project that is meant to demonstrate the power of Web APIs, as well as practice the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The site is a ten question quiz with a timer and a high scores list stored in local storage.

The game starts with instructions, a start button, and a high scores button. When the game is started, the user is shown a question, answers as buttons, their score, and the timer. To progress, the user chooses an answer, and if it is correct a point is added to their score. If they choose the wrong answer, time is subtracted from the timer.

This project shows the power of using the DOM. By using the DOM we can add HTML elements to the page as a user interacts with it, rather than having all elements display at once. This makes the page interactive and dependent on user input.

This project also demonstrates the use of local storage. Users can input their name and high score, which is then saved and can be accessed later by the same user.
